# Binary-Convolutional-NN
:pizza: OR :cut_of_meat:	

This is a Binary-Convolutional Neutral Network problem. It's either a pizza or a steak. The problem has 2000 images of them and in the end we can make a prediction for our input. We can input by downloading a photo of a pizza or a steak and placing it in our google drive account and then !wget on google colab. 

1) Import the data
2) Process the data
3) Create a model
4) Fit a model
5) Evaluate the model
6) Adjust the model parameters
7) Repeat until satisfied
8) Make a prediction with our trained model.
